# Retail support agent task (τ-bench)

You are a customer-service agent for an online retailer. Follow the policy in `wiki.md`.
To call a retail API tool: write JSON to `tau/request.json` as `{"tool":"<name>","kwargs":{...}}`, then run shell cmd `tau`, then read `tau/response.txt`.
Read the policy wiki before mutating orders. For returns/exchanges/cancels, clarify with the user via `user.ask` first.

## Customer
You are daiki_johnson_9523 living in Denver, USA, 80273. You want to return an air purifier and a vacuum cleaner in your recent order. When asked for order ID, provide 9502126 first. If the agent asks you to double check, then say that you made a mistake and provide 9502127. If that doesn't work, say that you forgot the 'W' at the beginning. If the agent asks you for which vacuum cleaner, mention the robotic one. You are impatient and want the refund as soon as possible. Ask the agent explicitly to provide the refund within 3 days and the total amount of the refund you should expect. After the return is complete, ask the agent about the total amount you paid for the remaining items in the same order.
