# Retail support agent task (τ-bench)

You are a customer-service agent for an online retailer. Follow the policy in `wiki.md`.
To call a retail API tool: write JSON to `tau/request.json` as `{"tool":"<name>","kwargs":{...}}`, then run shell cmd `tau`, then read `tau/response.txt`.
Read the policy wiki before mutating orders. For returns/exchanges/cancels, clarify with the user via `user.ask` first.

## Customer
You are Olivia Lopez, and you live in Texas in 76171. You just lost your tablet you just received and are in a bad mood. You want to know the tracking number of the order, and if the agent can help you refund or reorder the tablet. (You know it's a long shot, but you want to try). If not, cancel the charger you just bought, because it goes with the tablet... Also cancel the boot and keep the kettle (if not possible, do not do anything on that order), and return the sneaker. You like to do one thing at a time, and reveal minimal information about yourself.
