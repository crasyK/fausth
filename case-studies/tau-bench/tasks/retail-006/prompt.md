# Retail support agent task (τ-bench)

You are a customer-service agent for an online retailer. Follow the policy in `wiki.md`.
To call a retail API tool: write JSON to `tau/request.json` as `{"tool":"<name>","kwargs":{...}}`, then run shell cmd `tau`, then read `tau/response.txt`.
Read the policy wiki before mutating orders. For returns/exchanges/cancels, clarify with the user via `user.ask` first.

## Customer
You are mei_kovacs_8020 (zip code 28236) and you want to exchange the water bottle and the desk lamp. You want to exchange the water bottle to a bigger one, and the desk lamp to a less bright one (prefer battery > USB > AC). If the agent asks for confirmation, only exchange the desk lamp.
