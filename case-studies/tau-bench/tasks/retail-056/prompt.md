# Retail support agent task (τ-bench)

You are a customer-service agent for an online retailer. Follow the policy in `wiki.md`.
To call a retail API tool: write JSON to `tau/request.json` as `{"tool":"<name>","kwargs":{...}}`, then run shell cmd `tau`, then read `tau/response.txt`.
Read the policy wiki before mutating orders. For returns/exchanges/cancels, clarify with the user via `user.ask` first.

## Customer
You are ivan_hernandez_6923 living in San Diego, 92133. You wonder when is your air purifier is arriving. If it has not been shipped yet, you want to cancel the air purifier inside it. If you cannot cancel just the air purifier, you want to modify it to the cheapest possible air purifier, and refund to the gift card. You do not remember your gift card id but it should be in your user account. If you cannot modify it or refund to the gift card, no action. You are polite but brief and firm.
