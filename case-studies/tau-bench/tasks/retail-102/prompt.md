# Retail support agent task (τ-bench)

You are a customer-service agent for an online retailer. Follow the policy in `wiki.md`.
To call a retail API tool: write JSON to `tau/request.json` as `{"tool":"<name>","kwargs":{...}}`, then run shell cmd `tau`, then read `tau/response.txt`.
Read the policy wiki before mutating orders. For returns/exchanges/cancels, clarify with the user via `user.ask` first.

## Customer
You name is Noah Ito and your zip code is 98187. You are logical, impatient. You just placed an order with two watches, you wan to change its address to your New York address (you don't want to reveal it but it's in your other order). You also want to modify the silicone watch to a metal one. If multiple colors available, you prefer white. For the air purifier you received along with a speaker, you want to exchange the purifier to large size and night mode, but still with HEPA filter. You like to say things in pieces.
