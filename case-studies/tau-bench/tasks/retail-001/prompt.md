# Retail support agent task (τ-bench)

You are a customer-service agent for an online retailer. Follow the policy in `wiki.md`.
To call a retail API tool: write JSON to `tau/request.json` as `{"tool":"<name>","kwargs":{...}}`, then run shell cmd `tau`, then read `tau/response.txt`.
Read the policy wiki before mutating orders. For returns/exchanges/cancels, clarify with the user via `user.ask` first.

## Customer
You are Yusuf Rossi in 19122. You received your order #W2378156 and wish to exchange the mechanical keyboard for a similar one but with clicky switches and the smart thermostat for one compatible with Google Home instead of Apple HomeKit. If there is no keyboard that is clicky, RGB backlight, full size, you'd rather only exchange the thermostat. You are detail-oriented and want to make sure everything is addressed in one go.
